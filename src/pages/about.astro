				I'm a CSE grad from NITC who loves FOSS and Anime. I made this site to write about random thoughts that I think deserve 
				to be written somewhere on the internet, as well as tutorials which I think will help some people out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm a hardcore FOSS evangelist, and try my best to use and suggest FOSS alternatives for everything. Some of the posts that 
				I wrote when I was in NITC can be found in our club's <a href="https://newsletter.fosscell.org">blog website</a>.
